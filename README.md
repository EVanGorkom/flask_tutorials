# Flask Tutorials Repository

Welcome to the Flask Tutorials Repository! Here you will find a collection of tutorials aimed at helping you learn Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. Through these tutorials, you'll explore various organization methods, database integrations, and project types, including full-stack applications and API development.

## About

As I embark on the journey of learning Flask, I'm experimenting with different techniques, tools, and project structures to gain a deeper understanding of web development with Flask. This repository serves as a platform to document my learning process and share tutorials with the community.

## Tutorials

### 1. Introduction to Flask

Here I got started with Flask by building a simple web application to understand the basic concepts and structure of Flask projects. This project is a Monolith, but utilizes some separation principles.

### 2. Flask and a more robust Monolith

Here I explored how to integrate SQLite, a lightweight relational database management system, into Flask applications for data storage and retrieval and practiced rendering displays and utilizing templates more.

### 3. Building a RESTful API with Flask

Here I learned how Flask does not follow the typical convention of Django or Rails and can break the typical MVC model. (In progress)

### 4. Creating RESTful APIs with Flask

I learned how to design and implement RESTful APIs using Flask to facilitate communication between different software applications and broke from my typical organizational workflow by utilizing SQL queries instead of models.

## Organization

Each tutorial is organized into its respective directory within this repository. Each project is different from the last and is an attempt to build off of the experiences I learned from the previous.

## Feedback and Contributions

Your feedback is invaluable in improving my skills and making them more beneficial to follow typical convention. Feel free to reach out or offer suggestions!
